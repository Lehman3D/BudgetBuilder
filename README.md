# BudgetBuilder
Creates a budget from a balance input
See the src/BudgetBuilder.java code for the full project

This project creates a specific budget for myself using percentages on what I wanted to spend my money on. 
All you have to is input your current account balance and it automatically gets the date and time and creates
a budget based on how far through the month you are.
